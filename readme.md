# Thali Cordova Plugin

This project is a work in progress and not yet production-level quality.

The Thali Cordova Plugin is a [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) plugin for building peer-to-peer (P2P) networking apps on Android and iOS.

The Thali Cordova Plugin is layered on the [JXcore Cordova plugin](https://github.com/jxcore/jxcore-cordova), which uses [JXcore](http://jxcore.com/home/) to allow one to build mobile applications in JavaScript for Node.js.  

## Prerequisites

### Android

Download [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

Make sure to set your `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable:

Mac OS X (put in your `~/.bash_profile` file):
```
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=${PATH}:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

Linux (put in your `~/.bashrc` file):
```
export ANDROID_HOME=/<installation location>/Android/sdk
export PATH=${PATH}:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

Windows:
```
set ANDROID_HOME=C:\<installation location>\Android\sdk
set PATH=%PATH%;%ANDROID_HOME%\tools;%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools
```

### iOS

Download [Xcode 6](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), or later.

## Getting Started

### Install latest JXCore

Follow the instructions at [http://jxcore.com/downloads/](http://jxcore.com/downloads/). Please make sure you are using the default install which uses v8. There are [known issues](https://github.com/jxcore/jxcore/issues/822) with JXcore when it comes to packaging (something only done on the desktop) with Spider Monkey. When you're done, check that the
installation worked:
```
$ jx -jxv
v 0.3.1.0
```

### Install Cordova

(Check the [Android Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/4.0.0/guide_platforms_android_index.md.html#Android%20Platform%20Guide)
and [iOS Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/4.0.0/guide_platforms_ios_index.md.html#iOS%20Platform%20Guide) for detailed instructions.)

```
$ sudo jx npm install -g cordova
```

### Create a Cordova project

```
$ cordova create ThaliTest com.test.thalitest ThaliTest
```

### Using the Thali Cordova Plugin

To use Thali in a Cordova project one must do the following:

1. Make sure to add whatever platforms you are using in Cordova using `cordova platform add` (android | ios)
2. Add a subfolder to www named jxcore (case sensitivity matters)
3. Inside the jxcore folder create the app.js for your application
4. Inside the jxcore folder create the package.json for your application
 * `jx npm init` provides an easy to use wizard that will create a basic package.json file
5. Inside the jxcore folder run the command `jx npm install thali --autoremove "*.gz" --save`
6. Make sure to run `cordova build` as this is critical to moving key files into place

Now you can run your app. The Android devices need to have OS version Lollipop or later for things to work properly
(Thali uses class `BluetoothLeAdvertiser`, which was added in API level 21). Android 6.0 "Marshmallow" introduced 
a new permissions model where the user has to approve use of dangerous permission while the app is running. 
Thali Cordova Plugin requires ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION which needs user approval. This approval can be requested calling 
window.ThaliPermissions.requestLocationPermission() function. ThaliPermissions API locates at www/android/thaliPermissions.js.

Note that Thali uses a subdirectory in your project called thaliDontCheckin to manage certain downloads. Per the name of the directory, please don't check it in to your repro.

If you want to upgrade to a newer version of Thali_CordovaPlugin all you have to do is just edit your package.json 
with the version you want and then run 'jx npm install'. This will automatically update the Javascript files as well 
as uninstall the old plugin and install the new plugin.

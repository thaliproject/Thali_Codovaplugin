# Instructions for members of the Thali Development team

The following document records information of use to people who are developing the Thali project. Those using the Thali project don't need
to worry about the contents of this file.

## How this all connects together

We are trying to version, as one, what are actually two different systems. One system is NPM as used in JXCore. The other is
the Cordova plugin.

We have made the decision to drive the management process from NPM in the JXCore folder. This means that to install Thali
both into JXCore and into Cordova one must go to www/jxcore in the app project and do a `jx install`. This will install Thali's
Javascript files from NPM but it will also run a post install script that will then install Thali's Cordova plugin.

Normally to update a NPM one issues `jx npm install` or `jx npm update` and that will update the Javascript files.
That applies here as well, however, in addition the install script run from the NPM install is also smart enough to figure out if the Cordova plugin
needs to be updated and if so it will handle that as well.

To keep things somewhat clean we have inside of Thali's NPM directory a subdirectory called install. This isolates all the install
logic that has nothing to do with actually using Thali on a device. We then use a cordova post prepare script to remove this
directory before we publish so it doesn't end up on the device.

For all of this to work we have to have files in at least four different places:

* __NPM__ - We own the thali NPM module and we use `npm publish` from the thali sub-directory to publish there.
* __Thali_CordovaPlugin__ - This is our GIT repro from which we pull down the cordova plugin bytes
* __JXCore_CordovaPlugin__ - Our plugin has a dependency in its plugin.xml on JXCore's Cordova plugin
* __BinTray__ - We have our own bintray available [here](https://bintray.com/thali/Thali) where we publish the btconnectorlib2 JAR for Android

## Managing a new release
### Updating NPM
In preparation for a new release we have to publish a new version to NPM. Strictly speaking this is only necessary 
if we changed any of the .js files but realistically all of our stories require that so just assume it. 

1. Navigate to the thali sub-directory
2. Run `git status` and make sure it is clean
3. Run `npm version patch -m "Upgrade to %s because of..."`
  1. Note the word 'patch'. There are different levels that the version can be bumped to. Please read the [version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) docs to understand the choices and make sure you read up on [semver](http://semver.org/). This command will bump the version in the package.json and create a GIT update tagged with that version.
  2. On my Mac the npm version command does not work properly. It will upgrade the package.json but that is it. It won't do the GIT commit or the GIT tag. So once I run npm version I still have to do the commit and tagging myself. I first issued `git tag -a npmv1.0.21 -m "Thali NPM Version 1.0.21"` and then I issued `git push --tags`
4. Run `npm publish`

Also keep in mind that thali/install/install.js has a variable called 'thaliBranchName" that points to the branch 
where we will download the cordova code from. Right now that branch points at story_0 but soon enough we will 
change it to point at master. For most folks it's o.k. to leave this because when we dev on a local branch we tend
to get our files locally, not from NPM. But it's good to be aware of this variable's existence.

### The rest of the process
1. Write up a blog article for Thali's blog (this will be auto-reposted to Twitter)
2. Go to [stories](https://github.com/thaliproject/thali/blob/gh-pages/stories.md) and mark the story as completed. This requires both marking it completed in the table of contents and then use `~~` wrappers to strike out the entry in the body.
3. Go to GitHub and create a release
4. Go to internal metrics spreadsheet and add the release to both the shared code and blog tabs.

## Want to develop locally?

When writing code for Cordova one often finds oneself writing code directly inside the Cordova project one is testing with and then having
to remember to move all the content back to Thali_CordovaPlugin. It's annoying. To work around this do the following:

1. Go to your application project and create a subdirectory called `thaliDontCheckIn`
2. Then create a directory called `localdev` under `thaliDontCheckIn`
3. Now when you want to build your project with a new version of Thali_CordovaPlugin:
 1. Go to your App's www/jxcore subdirectory
 2. issue `jx npm install ../../../Thali_CordovaPlugin/thali --save`

Note that we do depend in other places on your Thali_CordovaPlugin directory being a sibling of your application's root.

## Windows Prerequisites

If you are using Windows to run the system with [PouchDB](pouchdb.com/), you will need to use [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp) to compile [leveldown](https://github.com/Level/leveldown)

The following software is required:
- Visual Studio 2013/2015
- Python 2.7.x

Follow the [node-gyp installation documentation](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation) to ensure that Python is properly set.  The easiest way for Python to work is to have it set in your PATH environment variable.

To change the version of Visual Studio used, use the `--msvs_version` option during the installation, for example to use Visual Studio 2015:
```
$ jx npm install --msvs_version=2015
```

## Android Requirements

We use Maven to distribute an AAR we need to support Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on Android. The instructions below specify how to build the AAR and develop with it locally.

### Use Gradle

For the command line build process, you should use gradle. Set the system environment variable `ANDROID_BUILD` to `gradle`.

### Build the P2P library to local Maven

#### Install Maven locally
Follow the instructions here: http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

#### Clone the Thali Cordova Plugin library
`$ git clone https://github.com/thaliproject/Thali_CordovaPlugin_BtLibrary.git`  

#### Build the Thali Cordova Plugin library
At the root of the Thali Cordova Plugin Library that you just git cloned:  

`$ cd BtConnectorLib`

Note: On OS X (and probably Linux) the gradlew file is cloned without execution permissions. So you have to run:

`$ chmod u+x gradlew`

before you will be able to run the next command.

`$ ./gradlew build install`  

Once built the library should be visible in:  
`<user folder>\.m2\repository\org\thaliproject\p2p\btconnectorlib\btconnectorlib2\0.0.1`

Once built the library should be visible in:  
`<user folder>\.m2\repository\org\thaliproject\p2p\btconnectorlib\btconnectorlib2\0.0.1`


## Unit Testing the Thali Cordova Plugin

The Thali Cordova plugin uses the [Tape](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape) tap-producing test harness for node
and browsers.

Right now our testing framework is primarily designed to help us test as we are developing so we have a script
that will automatically setup the test environment. Just do the following:

```
$ cd Thali_CordovaPlugin/thali/install
$ chmod u+x setUpTests.sh
$ jx npm run testSetup
```

This will set up a parallel project called ThaliTest.

### Desktop Testing

```
$ cd ThaliTest/www/jxcore
$ jx npm run test
```

### Mobile Testing

Testing is also available on the mobile devices as well.  This will use the regular `Mobile` calls directly through
Cordova to talk to the underlying system.

Go inside of the ThaliTest project and run

```
$ cordova build android
$ cordova build ios
```

Now deploy with your favorite tool. Note that you need two phones running the tests at the same time in order to
pass all the tests as some test our networking. You should be able to see the test results in your developer
console.

### Adding new tests

We run on both the desktop and mobile all the tests in the test/www/jxcore directory that have a file name of the form
test*.js. We have protections to make sure that tests that shouldn't run on the desktop don't as well as to make
sure that objects that use the Mobile mock don't mess up things for everyone else. Check the test code for examples.

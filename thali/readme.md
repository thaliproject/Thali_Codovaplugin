# Thali Cordova Plugin

This project is a work in progress and not yet production-level quality.

The Thali Cordova Plugin is a [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) plugin for building peer-to-peer (P2P) networking apps on Android and iOS.

The Thali Cordova Plugin is layered on the [JXcore Cordova plugin](https://github.com/jxcore/jxcore-cordova), which uses [JXcore](http://jxcore.com/home/) to allow one to build mobile applications in JavaScript for Node.JS.  

## Prerequisites

### Android

Download [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

Make sure to set your `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable:

Mac OS X (put in your `~/.bash_profile` file):
```
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=${PATH}:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

Linux (put in your `~/.bashrc` file):
```
export ANDROID_HOME=/<installation location>/Android/sdk
export PATH=${PATH}:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

Windows:
```
set ANDROID_HOME=C:\<installation location>\Android\sdk
set PATH=%PATH%;%ANDROID_HOME%\tools;%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools
```

### iOS

Download [Xcode 6](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), or later.

## Getting Started

### Install latest JXCore

Follow the instructions at [http://jxcore.com/downloads/](http://jxcore.com/downloads/). When you're done, check that the
installation worked:
```
$ jx -jxv
v 0.3.0.5
```

### Install Cordova

(Check the [Android Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/4.0.0/guide_platforms_android_index.md.html#Android%20Platform%20Guide)
and [iOS Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/4.0.0/guide_platforms_ios_index.md.html#iOS%20Platform%20Guide) for detailed instructions.)

```
$ sudo jx install -g cordova
```

### Create a Cordova project

```
$ cordova create ThaliTest com.test.thalitest ThaliTest
```

### Using the Thali Cordova Plugin

To use Thali in a Cordova project one must do the following:

5. Make sure to add whatever platforms you are using in Cordova using `cordova platform add` (android | ios)
1. Add a subfolder to www named jxcore (case sensitivity matters)
2. Inside the jxcore folder create the app.js for your application
3. Inside the jxcore folder create the package.json for your application
 * `jx npm init` provides an easy to use wizard that will create a basic package.json file
4. Inside the jxcore folder run the command `jx install thali --autoremove "*.gz" --save`
5. Make sure to run `cordova build` as this is critical to moving key files into place
 * Yes, an exception did get thrown during the build. No, it isn't harmful. No, we haven't quite figured out
 why it gets thrown, the verbose debug logs aren't saying anything useful.

Now you can run your app.

Note that Thali uses a subdirectory in your project called thaliDontCheckin to manage certain downloads. Per the name of the directory, please don't check it in to your repro.

If you want to upgrade to a newer version of Thali_CordovaPlugin all you have to do is just edit your package.json 
with the version you want and then run 'jx install'. This will automatically update the Javascript files as well 
as uninstall the old plugin and install the new plugin.

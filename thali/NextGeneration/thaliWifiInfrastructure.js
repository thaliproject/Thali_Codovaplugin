 *
 * This is the interface used to manage local discover of peers over a Wi-Fi
 * Infrastructure mode access point.
 *
 * All the methods defined in this file are asynchronous. However any time a
 * method is called the invocation will immediately return but the request will
 * actually be put on a queue and all incoming requests will be run out of that
 * queue. This means that if one calls two start methods on say advertising or
 * discovery then the first start method will execute, call back its promise and
 * only then will the second start method start running. This restriction is in
 * place to simplify the state model and reduce testing.
 *
 * All stop methods in this file are idempotent so they can be called multiple
 * times in a row without causing a state change.
 */

/**
 * This creates an object to manage a WiFi instance. During production we will
 * have exactly one instance running but for testing purposes it's very useful
 * to be able to run multiple instances. So long as the SSDP code uses a
 * different port to advertise for responses for each instance and as the router
 * instances are already specified to use whatever ports are available the
 * different instances should not run into each other.

 * This method will start advertising the peer's presence over the local Wi-Fi

 * bind the socket the SSDP multicast address 239.255.255.250 and port 1900 MUST
 * be chosen as they are the reserved address and port for SSDP.
 *
 * __OPEN ISSUE:__ What happens on Android or iOS or the desktop OS's for that
 * matter if multiple apps all try to bind to the same UDP multicast address?
 * It should be fine. But it's important to find out so that other apps can't
 * block us.
 *
 * Also note that the implementation of
 * SSDP MUST recognize advertisements from its own instance and ignore them.
 * However it is possible to have multiple independent instances of
 * ThaliWiFiInfrastructure on the same device and we MUST process advertisements
 * from other instances of ThaliWifiInfrastructure on the same device.
 *
 * This method will also cause the Express app passed in to be hosted in a
 * HTTP server configured with the device's local IP. In other words, the
 * externally available HTTP server is not actually started and made externally
 * available until this method is called. This is different than {@link
 * module:thaliMobileNative} where the server is started on 127.0.0.1 as soon as
 * {@link module:thaliMobileNative.start} is called but isn't made externally
 * available over the non-TCP transport until the equivalent of this method is
 * called. If the device switches access points (e.g. the BSSID changes) or if
 * WiFi is lost then the server will be shut down. It is up to the caller to
 * catch the networkChanged event and to call start advertising again.
 *
 * __OPEN ISSUE:__ If we have a properly configured multiple AP network then
 * all the APs will have different BSSID values but identical SSID values and
 * the device should be able to keep the same IP. In that case do we want to
 * specify that if the BSSID changes but the SSID does not then we shouldn't
 * shut down the server?
 *
 * Each time this method is called it will cause the local advertisement to
 * change just enough to notify other peers that this peer has new data to
 * retrieve. No details will be provided about the peer on who the changes are
 * for. All that is provided is a flag just indicating that something has
 * changed. It is up to other peer to connect and retrieve details on what has
 * changed if they are interested. The way this flag MUST be implemented is by
 * creating a UUID the first time startUpdateAdvertisingAndListening is called
 * and maintaining that UUID until stopAdvertisingAndListening is called. When
 * the UUID is created a generation counter MUST be set to 0. Every subsequent
 * call to startUpdateAdvertisingAndListening until the counter is reset MUST
 * increment the counter by 1. The USN set by a call to
 * startUpdateAdvertisingAndListening MUST be of the form `data:` + uuid.v4() +
 * `:` + generation.
 *
 * By design this method is intended to be called multiple times without
 * calling stop as each call causes the currently notification flag to change.

/**
 * [NOT IMPLEMENTED]
 *
 * For the definition of this event please see {@link
 * module:thaliMobileNativeWrapper~networkChangedNonTCP}.
 *
 * The WiFi layer MUST NOT emit this event unless we are running on Linux,
 * OS/X or Windows. In the case that we are running on those platforms then If
 * we are running on those platforms then bluetoothLowEnergy and bluetooth MUST
 * both return radioState set to `doNotCare`. Also note that these platforms
 * don't generally support a push based way to detect WiFi state (at least not
 * without writing native code). So for now we can use polling and something
 * like [network-scanner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/network-scanner) to give
 * us some sense of the system's state.

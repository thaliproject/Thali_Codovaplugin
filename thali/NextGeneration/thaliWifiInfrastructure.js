 * This is the interface used to manage local discover of peers over a Wi-Fi Infrastructure mode access point.
 *
 * All the methods defined in this file are asynchronous. However any time a method is called the invocation will
 * immediately return but the request will actually be put on a queue and all incoming requests will be run out of that
 * queue. This means that if one calls two start methods on say advertising or discovery then the first start method
 * will execute, call back its promise and only then will the second start method start running. This restriction is in
 * place to simplify the state model and reduce testing.
 *
 * All stop methods in this file are idempotent so they can be called multiple times in a row without causing
 * a state change.

 *
 * If the start fails then the object is not in start state.
 *
 * This method is not idempotent (even though it could be). If called two times in a row without an intervening stop a
 * "Call Stop!" Error MUST be returned.

/**
 * This method will start advertising the peer's presence over the local Wi-Fi Infrastructure Mode discovery
 * mechanism (currently SSDP). When creating the UDP socket for SSDP the socket MUST be "udp4". When socket.bind is
 * called to bind the socket to the SSDP multicast address and port, a random port will automatically be picked by
 * Node.js to bind the UDP port to locally. This address is needed in order to set the location header in SSDP
 * messages. This port can be discovered via socket.address().port in the callback to the socket.bind call. Note that
 * we MUST make sure that the SSDP local UDP port is picked randomly so we do not have collisions between multiple
 * instances of {@link module:ThaliWifiInfrastructure}. Also note that the implementation of SSDP MUST recognize
 * advertisements from its own instance and ignore them. However it is possible to have multiple independent instances
 * of ThaliWiFiInfrastructure on the same device and we MUST process advertisements from other instances of
 * ThaliWifiInfrastructure on the same device.
 *
 * This method will also cause the Express app passed in to be hosted in a HTTP
 * server configured with the device's local IP. In other words, the externally available HTTP server is not actually
 * started and made externally available until this method is called. This is different than
 * {@link module:thaliMobileNative} where the server is started on 127.0.0.1 as soon as
 * {@link module:thaliMobileNative.start} is called but isn't made externally available over the non-TCP transport until
 * the equivalent of this method is called. If the device switches access points (e.g. the BSSID changes) or
 * if WiFi is lost then the server will be shut down. It is up to the caller to catch the networkChanged event
 * and to call start advertising again.
 *
 * __OPEN ISSUE:__ If we have a properly configured multiple AP network then all the APs will have different BSSID
 * values but identical SSID values and the device should be able to keep the same IP. In that case do we want to
 * specify that if the BSSID changes but the SSID does not then we shouldn't shut down the server?
 *
 * Each time this method is called it will cause the local advertisement to change just enough to notify other peers
 * that this peer has new data to retrieve. No details will be provided about the peer on who the changes are for.
 * All that is provided is a flag just indicating that something has changed. It is up to other peer to connect
 * and retrieve details on what has changed if they are interested.
 *
 * By design this method is intended to be called multiple times without calling stop as each call causes the
 * currently notification flag to change.

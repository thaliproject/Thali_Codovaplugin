/**
 * @classdesc This class handles determining who to notify about changes to a
 * local database. We are given a list of peers to look for, we wait for changes
 * in the local DB and then we check to see if any of those peers haven't sync'd
 * those changes and if so then we raise a notification with the
 * thaliNotificationServer.
 *
 * When we are told to notify a peer of a change we have to remember the need to
 * notify that peer even across reboots of the app. Otherwise if the app stops
 * and restarts we won't know who we were supposed to notify and there is no new
 * data coming in that will tell us. For each peer we care about we will track
 * what is the last sequence number they have synch'd up to. We can find this
 * information by retrieving the `_Local/thali<peer ID>` record for that peer.
 * If it doesn't exist then we treat their last sync'd sequence number as 0. We
 * can get the current sequence number for the database from the PouchDB info()
 * function in the update_seq field. Now we just compare the number in the
 * _Local record against the current sequence number and we know who we need to
 * notify. See http://thaliproject.org/ReplicationAcrossDiscoveryProtocol/ for
 * details.
 *
 * BUGBUG: Although this is a 'new' able class in reality it is only intended to
 * be used as a singleton. There must not be more than one instance of this
 * class in the same app or errors will occur. We absolutely can fix that if
 * someone has a killer scenario they are shipping that needs this fixed.

/**
 * Will start monitoring the submitted pouchDB and updating the notification
 * layer with peers to notify of changes.
 *
 * This method is idempotent if called with the same argument.
 *
 * Whenever start is called we have to re-evaluate our situation. If start
 * is called with the same public key list as the previous call then we MUST
 * do nothing. By "same" we mean object equality only. If it is called with a
 * new list then we MUST re-run beacon generation and advertise a new ID.
 *
 * BUGBUG: Obviously we should be nicer and do things like check if the new
 * lists's content is the same as the old list. Also even if the lists are
 * different if the new list just removes entries from the old list then we can
 * just update the version of folks to notify on disk but ignore them in memory
 * (for reasons described below). There are other optimizations possible but
 * let's first get things running.
 *
 * Every standard interval we will check to see if one of two
 * possible situations exist:
 *
 * Beacons have expired - When we publish beacons we do so with an expiration
 * date. If that date has been reached then we have to generate the entire
 * beacon string afresh.
 *
 * Beacons have changed - Every time we update our advertising ID we force
 * everyone to come and get the new beacons. This is expensive for folks'
 * batteries. So ideally we want to change those IDs as infrequently as
 * possible. Let's look at the events that might cause us to need to change our
 * ID and see how we can handle them.
 *
 * - Add a new beacon - Imagine we have a new person we need to notify about
 * changes. Right now that can only happen via a call to start with an updated
 * list of people to notify. We have to change the ID on this one because it's
 * possible that the targeted device already retrieved the beacons under the
 * current ID and so won't know there is a new beacon. So anytime we create
 * a new beacon we need to change our advertising ID. Note however that we do
 * not have to change our ephemeral key in this case and we do not have to
 * change any of the existing beacons. We just have to add the new one.
 *
 * - Remove a beacon - This can happen in two different ways. One way is if the
 * targeted device has synch'd and we don't need to advertise their beacon any
 * more. I don't know if we will even bother implementing this. Seems like it
 * would leak too much data we don't need to leak. The other reason though is if
 * we have removed someone from our permission list. That is kind of tricky and
 * I suspect for now we just won't implement remove a beacon logic. Instead
 * when we do have to change our ID we will refresh all the beacons, or not, see
 * below.
 *
 * - Change an existing beacon - Imagine we have advertised a beacon for device
 * X when sequence number was Y and now sequence number is Z (Z > Y). We have a
 * challenge that device X has already synched with the existing ID and so if we
 * don't change the ID they won't realize we have new information for them. But
 * we have to remember that once a device has sync'd with us for any reason then
 * they know we are around and if immediately knowing about changes is important
 * to them then they should probably use live sync. The point is that it's
 * probably o.k. to not immediately push out a new ID when dealing with changes
 * to an existing beacon. What we can do is use a long time interval between
 * full refreshes of the beacon list and depend on sync behavior to catch
 * updates in the intervals between (e.g. if it matters then apps should be
 * using live replication).
 *
 * Where this leaves us is that we do need to have some kind of interval
 * (preferably pretty long, say 10 minutes, but this should be configurable).
 * When that interval is up then we need to completely refresh all the tokens.
 * This means checking our list of users, seeing what ID they have synch'd up
 * to, identifying everyone who isn't sync'd up and generating an entire new
 * beacon string for them. If there are no beacons to advertise then we will
 * submit an empty list.
 *
 * Although unlikely it is theoretically possible for processing the list to
 * take long enough that we bump into the next interval. In that case we
 * MUST finish the current interval and skip the intervals we 'ran over' into.
 *
 * Now just to complicate things we really don't want to have any timers running
 * unless we absolutely have to because they require waking up the whole thread
 * and thus the core and aren't battery friendly. So typically the only timer
 * we will have running is the token expiration timer which should be very
 * long (as in days). We are assuming that the timer code is managed by the OS
 * and doesn't require keeping node.js around but if it does then we'll have to
 * come up with an alternative approach for the expiration timer.
 *
 * Otherwise we will have a standard interval to wait before we update beacons
 * even if they need updating. The idea then being that we have a listener on
 * the DB and if we get a change notification we will measure how long it has
 * been since we last did a beacon update. If we are at or beyond the update
 * window then we will do the update immediately. If we are before the window
 * then we will set a timer to wake us up when the window arrives. This means
 * that if we get any more change updates and we detect that we already have a
 * timer running we won't worry about the update since we will catch it when
 * the timer goes off. And yes, if we get updates while we are in the middle of
 * a beacon update we should be fine since the beacon just says "new stuff" not
 * how new. So any db updates that occur while updating the beacons can be
 * safely ignored. The really complex scenario is what do we do if start is
 * called while we are in the middle of updating the beacons? My feeling is that
 * we should just set a new timer and call it a day.

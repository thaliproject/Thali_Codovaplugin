/**
 * @classdesc This class will listen for
 * {@link module:thaliNotificationClient.event:peerAdvertisesDataForUs} events
 * and then schedule replications.
 *
 * If we receive a notification for a peer that is on our list then we will
 * check to see if we have already enqueued a job for them. If we have then we
 * will have to kill it and create a new job since a second notification
 * should really only have happened if some the values for the peer have
 * changed. If there is no enqueued job or if there is a running job then we
 * must enqueue a replication work item.
 *
 * Note: Functionality below is blocked on https://github.com/thaliproject/Thali_CordovaPlugin/issues/734
 * If we receive a notification that a peer is no longer available and there
 * is a queued job for that peer then we will remove the queued job. If there
 * is a running job then we will leave that job alone as presumably it will
 * fail on its own or succeed since notifications that peers have gone isn't
 * an exact science.
 *
 * It is possible for us to discover the same peer over two different
 * transports (say Bluetooth and WiFi). In that case we treat each transport
 * separately. In other words, we treat the combination of transport and user
 * ID as a single value so that if we simultaneously find the same peer over
 * two transports then we will schedule two replications. It is up to the peer
 * pool manager to detect when we are trying to do the same action type for
 * the same peer over two different transports and to then pick which one it
 * prefers (if any, maybe it wants both).
 *
 * BUGBUG: In the interests of time we currently will only support replicating
 * data from a single remote database for all users. This is clearly silly and
 * we should move to a model where each user can have multiple databases
 * specified for them.
 *
 * @public
 * @param {PouchDB} PouchDB The factory we will use to create the database we
 * will replicate all changes to.
 * @param {string} dbName The name of the DB. The name of the remote DB MUST be
 * http://[host from discovery]:[port from discovery]/db/[name] where name is
 * taken from pouchDB.info's db_name field.
 * @param {module:thaliPeerPoolInterface~ThaliPeerPoolInterface} thaliPeerPoolInterface
 * @param {Crypto.ECDH} ecdhForLocalDevice A Crypto.ECDH object initialized
 * with the local device's public and private keys.
 * @constructor

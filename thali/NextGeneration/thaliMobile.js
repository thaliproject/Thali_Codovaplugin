/**
 * It is the job of this module to provide the most reliable guesses (and that
 * is what they are) as to when a peer is and is not available. The module MUST
 * err on the side of saying that a peer is available over saying they are not
 * available.
 *
 * The module MUST guarantee to its listeners (unlike {@link
 * module:thaliMobileNative}) that once it has fired a peerAvailabilityChanged
 * event for a specific peerIdentifier + connectionType combination that it will
 * not fire another peerAvailabilityChanged event for that peerIdentifier +
 * connectionType combination unless the combination has a new hostAddress or
 * portNumber.
 *
 * Note that this code explicitly does not do any kind of duplicate detection
 * for the same peerIdentifier across different connectionTypes. This is because
 * we want to surface to the caller all the ways a particular peer is available.
 *
 * This means that if this code receives multiple redundant notifications from
 * the various sources it is listening to about the same peerIdentifier and
 * connectionType combination then it must silently discard the duplicates.
 *
 * ## Android + BLE + Bluetooth
 *
 * When dealing with announcing that a peer has disappeared it is up to this
 * code to apply relevant heuristics. For example, in the case of Android it is
 * possible for a Thali app to go into the background. When this happens we
 * lower the power of the BLE status announcements but we don't change the
 * Bluetooth power. This means that a peer can seem to disappear when in fact
 * they are still in range of Bluetooth. This behavior is necessary to preserve
 * battery. This complicates things because the Android BLE stack never actually
 * says a peer is gone. Rather it sends a steady stream of announcements that
 * the peer is available and then stops when it doesn't see the peer anymore. So
 * this code has to notice those announcements and decide at what point after
 * they have stopped to declare the peer gone. In general we should experiment
 * with values like 30 seconds before deciding that a peer is gone. But why not
 * even longer?
 *
 * __Open Issue:__ How long should we wait after we don't hear any updates on
 * a peer being available over Android before we declare them gone?
 *
 * __Open Issue:__ A really obvious optimization would be to hook this code
 * into the {@link module:TCPServersManager} so it could see if we have a
 * Bluetooth or MPCF connection running with a particular peer. If we do then
 * obviously we wouldn't want to declare them gone even if we don't see them on
 * BLE or if MPCF told us they were gone.
 *
 * If an attempt to connect to a peer via Bluetooth whose presence we have
 * previously advertised via peerAvailabilityChanged should fail then we MUST
 * use our own heuristics to decide if we should mark the peer as no longer
 * available. Generally speaking if we still see the peer via BLE then we should
 * continue to mark them as available. Note that available doesn't mean
 * reachable. It is very easy for a peer to get overwhelmed with Bluetooth
 * requests and so be near but not able to accept a request.
 *
 * If we have been notified via a networkChanged event that either BLE or
 * Bluetooth is no longer available then we MUST mark all peers discovered via
 * BLE as no longer being present and send peerAvailabilityChanged events
 * reporting this status change. In theory we could make things more complex by
 * specifying that if BLE is turned off and Bluetooth isn't then we could
 * continue to say that the Bluetooth peers are there. But in practical terms it
 * isn't clear if this situation is possible (e.g. I suspect one can only turn
 * off Bluetooth, not sub-select between BLE and Bluetooth) and second it's more
 * complexity than we really need at this point.
 *
 * If we have been notified via a discoveryAdvertisingStatus event that
 * discovery is no longer available then we MUST treat existing discovered
 * Bluetooth peers as no longer being available and send peerAvailabilityChanged
 * events reporting this fact. Eventually we might get more flexible here and
 * allow Bluetooth peers to remain "available" and just use the connection
 * heuristics described previously to mark them as absent when necessary. But
 * for now let's keep things simple.
 *
 * If we have been notified via a discoveryAdvertisingStatus event that
 * advertising is no longer available this should not cause any change in our
 * information about peers we have discovered or will yet discover.
 *
 * ## iOS + MPCF
 *
 * In the case of the MPCF the native layer has an explicit lostPeer message.
 * But we aren't completely sure if it's totally reliable. So we either can
 * immediately declare the peer gone when we get lostPeer or we can take note of
 * the lostPeer message and then wait a bit before declaring the peer gone. Note
 * that we would only see this at the Node.js layer via a {@link
 * module:thaliMobileNativeWrapper~nonTCPPeerAvailabilityChanged} event.
 *
 * __Open Issue:__ How does MPCF deal with peers who have gone out of range?
 * Do they regularly send foundPeer messages or do they send one foundPeer
 * message and go quiet until they send a lostPeer message after a bit?
 *
 * __Open Issue:__ How reliable is the lostPeer message from MPCF? I believe
 * we have had a suspicion that even if we get a lostPeer we might still be able
 * to open a connection to that peer successfully (this would make sense if
 * discovery is over Bluetooth and data transfer over Wifi). But we need to now
 * make this concrete since we have to decide if we are going to put this
 * suspicion into our code.
 *
 * If an attempt to connect to a peer via MPCF whose presence we have previously
 * advertised via peerAvailabilityChanged should fail we MUST use our own
 * heuristics to decide if we should mark the peer as no longer available.
 * Typically we should allow several failed connection attempts before we decide
 * to mark the peer as no longer present.
 *
 * If we have been notified via a networkChanged event that one of Bluetooth or
 * Wifi are no longer available but not both then this should not cause any
 * immediate action since MPCF seems able to run exclusively over one transport
 * or the other.
 *
 * If however we have been notified via a networkChanged even that both
 * Bluetooth and Wifi are no longer available then we MUST mark all peers that
 * we have previously advertised as available as now being unavailable and
 * advertise this change via the peerAvailabilityChanged event.
 *
 * If we have been notified via a discoveryAdvertisingStatus event that
 * discovery is no longer available then we MUST change the availability of
 * peers discovered via MPCF as not available and advertise this fact via
 * peerAvailabilityChanged.
 *
 * __Open Issue:__ The MPCF explicitly states that one shouldn't keep discovery
 * on all the time. One suspects this is because they are using Bluetooth for
 * discovery. As such as may need to cycle discovery on and off to save battery.
 * In that case we will need to change the logic above so that turning off
 * discovery doesn't make the peer appear to be gone.
 *
 * If we have been notified via a discoveryAdvertisingStatus even that
 * advertising is no longer available then this should not cause any change in
 * our peer status.
 *
 * ## Wifi
 *
 * In the case of Wifi SSDP supports sending both announcements of
 * availability as well as announcements that one is going off line. If we
 * receive an announcement that a peer is going away then we can trust that
 * since it means the peer is deactivating its SSDP stack. But we can't rely on
 * receiving such an announcement since obviously if a peer just walks away
 * nothing will be said. So we MUST set a timer after receiving a SSDP
 * announcement for a peer (we will receive this via a {@link
 * module:ThaliWifiInfrastructure~wifiPeerAvailabilityChanged} event) and if we
 * don't hear an announcement that they are gone then we MUST automatically
 * generate such an announcement ourselves.
 *
 * Unlike the non-TCP transports, we do not use a proxy architecture with Wifi
 * and therefore do not know if an attempted connection succeeded or not. This
 * is why there is no equivalent requirement here to the ones above specifying
 * that failed connections should cause us to mark a peer as not available.
 *
 * If we have been notified via a networkChanged event that Wifi is no longer
 * available then all peers discovered via Wifi MUST be marked as not present
 * and this fact advertised via peerAvailabilityChanged.
 *
 * If we have been notified via a discoveryAdvertisingStatus event that
 * discovery is no longer available then we MUST change the availability of
 * peers discovered via Wifi to not available and advertise this fact via
 * peerAvailabilityChanged. This is a bit harsh since if Wifi is still working
 * we certainly could connect to those peers but once discovery is off we have
 * no way of knowing if the peer has disappeared and since we don't have a proxy
 * architecture we can't detect failed connections. So it's just easier for now
 * to just treat the peers as gone.
 *
 * If we have been notified via a discoveryAdvertisingStatus event that
 * advertising is no longer available then this should not cause any change in
 * our peer status.
 *
 * ## General guidelines on handling nonTCPPeerAvailabilityChanged and
 * wifiPeerAvailabilityChanged events
 *
 * If we receive a {@link
 * module:thaliMobileNativeWrapper~nonTCPPeerAvailabilityChanged} event then all
 * we have to do is return the arguments below as taken from the event with the
 * exception of setting hostAddress to 127.0.0.1 unless the peer is not
 * available in which case we should set both hostAddress and portNumber to
 * null.
 *
 * If we receive a {@link
 * module:ThaliWifiInfrastructure~wifiPeerAvailabilityChanged} event then all we
 * have to do is return the arguments below as taken from the event with the
 * exception of setting something reasonable for the suggestedTCPTimeout.
 *
 * @public
 * @event module:thaliMobile.event:peerAvailabilityChanged
 * @type {Object}
 * @property {string} peerIdentifier This is exclusively used to detect if
 * this is a repeat announcement or if a peer has gone to correlate it to the
 * announcement of the peer's presence. But this value is not used to establish
 * a connection to the peer, the hostAddress and portNumber handle that.
 * @property {string} hostAddress The IP/DNS address to connect to or null if
 * this is an announcement that the peer is no longer available.
 * @property {number} portNumber The port to connect to on the given
 * hostAddress or null if this is an announcement that the peer is no longer
 * available.
 * @property {number} suggestedTCPTimeout Provides a hint to what time out to
 * put on the TCP connection. For some transports a handshake can take quite a
 * long time.
 * @property {connectionTypes} connectionType Defines the kind of connection
 * that the request will eventually go over. This information is needed so that
 * we can better manage how we use the different transport types available to
 * us.

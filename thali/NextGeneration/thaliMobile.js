        EVENTS

/**
 * It is the job of this module to provide the most reliable guesses (and that
 * is what they are) as to when a peer is and is not available. The module MUST
 * err on the side of saying that a peer is available over saying they are not
 * available.
 *
 * The module MUST guarantee to its listeners (unlike {@link
 * module:thaliMobileNative}) that once it has fired a peerAvailabilityChanged
 * event for a specific peerIdentifier + connectionType combination that it will
 * not fire another peerAvailabilityChanged event for that peerIdentifier +
 * connectionType combination unless the combination has a new hostAddress,
 * portNumber or generation. The newAddressPort boolean on the
 * peerAvailabilityChanged event will flag when a peer moves its address or
 * port.
 *
 * Note that this code explicitly does not do any kind of duplicate detection
 * for the same peerIdentifier across different connectionTypes. This is because
 * we want to surface to the caller all the ways a particular peer is available.
 *
 * This means that if this code receives multiple redundant notifications from
 * the various sources it is listening to about the same peerIdentifier and
 * connectionType combination then it must silently discard the duplicates.
 *
 * ## Peer availability cache
 *
 * The code is based on a model where we have a cache we use to track which
 * peers are currently available and we use that cache to store additional
 * information. The details for different transports are given below.
 *
 * It is assumed that peers in the availability cache are indexed by a
 * combination of their peer identifier (but not their generation) as well as
 * their connection type. So if in the Android section we say a peer is in the
 * availability cache we mean an entry with the same peer identifier and the
 * Android connection type.
 *
 * The availability cache MUST make sure that its size is not allowed to grow
 * without bound. Each connection type MUST have its own limit. Generally
 * speaking the limit should be generous enough that under any circumstance but
 * a direct DOS attack we shouldn't violate that limit. Therefore if adding a
 * peer would cause the limit to be violated then we MUST ignore the peer and
 * fire a discoveryDOS event and leave it to whomever is listening to that event
 * to respond appropriately.
 *
 * ## Android + BLE + Bluetooth
 *
 * ### Handling nonTCPPeerAvailabilityChanged events
 *
 * In this section we will walk through different possible scenarios when we
 * receive a nonTCPPeerAvailabilityChanged event in Android
 *
 * #### peerAvailable === true
 *
 * If the peer is not in the availability cache then we MUST put the peer's
 * identifier, generation, portNumber and the current milliseconds since the
 * epoch into the availability cache and issue a peerAvailabilityChanged event
 * with the given peerIdentifier and connectionType, peerAvailable set to true,
 * generation set as in the nonTCPPeerAvailabilityChanged event and
 * newAddressPort set to false.
 *
 * If the peer is in the availability cache then we MUST compare the generation
 * and portNumber in the event against the same values in the availability
 * cache. If either value is different then we will issue a new
 * peerAvailabilityChanged event as given below. If the generation values are
 * the same but the time that has elapsed since the availability entry was
 * recorded is >= thaliConfig.minimumUpdateWindow * 255 (which is the minimum
 * time it would take for the 1 byte Android beacon to wrap around) then we MUST
 * treat the generation is if it had changed.
 *
 * If we are to issue a new peerAvailabilityChanged event per the previous
 * paragraph then we MUST update the availability cache with the new portNumber
 * (if any) and the new generation. If this was a case where the two generation
 * numbers actually matched but we decided to update because of the time check
 * then we MUST update the time in the availability cache to the current time in
 * milliseconds since the last epoch. The issued peerAvailabilityChanged event
 * MUST have its peerIdentifier, connectionType and generation set as per the
 * new event. It MUST set peerAvailable to true. If the portNumber in the event
 * was different than the value in the availability cache then newAddressPort
 * MUST be set to true.
 *
 * #### peerAvailable === false
 *
 * If we get a peerAvailable === false event then we MUST check the peer
 * availability cache and if the peer is listed then we MUST remove the peer
 * from the cache and issue a peerAvailabilityChanged event with the given
 * peerIdentifier and connectionType but with the peerAvailable set to false
 * and generation and newAddressPort set to null.
 *
 * If we get a peerAvailable === false event for a peer that is not in the peer
 * availability cache then we MUST ignore the event.
 *
 * ### Heuristics for marking peers as not available
 *
 * The heuristics for tracking peers in the native layer is based just on
 * seeing if we have discovered them recently. It doesn't take into account
 * what happens if we tried to connect to the peer and the connection fails. So
 * for that we need our own heuristics.
 *
 * To do this when we get a successful response to a getPeerHostInfo call for
 * an Android peer we MUST record in the availability cache the fact that there
 * is an active session with that peer. In addition if there is a timer running
 * (see below) then we MUST cancel that timer.
 *
 * If we receive a peerAvailable === true event and if there is no open session
 * recorded in the availability cache for that peer then we MUST create a timer
 * that will go off after thaliConfig.WAIT_UNTIL_ANDROID_PEER_GONE_MS.
 *
 * If we receive a failedConnection event from createPeerListener for a peer who
 * is in the availability cache then we MUST mark the peer's session as closed
 * in the availability cache and set the timer to go off after
 * thaliConfig.WAIT_UNTIL_ANDROID_PEER_GONE_MS.
 *
 * If the timer goes off and if the peer is still in the availability cache
 * (which is should be since there isn't another way to pull a peer out of the
 * cache) then the peer MUST be removed the availability cache and a
 * peerAvailabilityChanged event with the given peerIdentifier and
 * connectionType but with peerAvailable set to false and generation and
 * newAddressPort set to null.
 *
 * ### Handling networkChanged events
 *
 * If we have been notified via a networkChanged event that either BLE or
 * Bluetooth is no longer available then we MUST remove all peers discovered via
 * BLE from the availability cache and send peerAvailabilityChanged events
 * reporting this status change. In theory we could make things more complex by
 * specifying that if BLE is turned off and Bluetooth isn't then we could
 * continue to say that the Bluetooth peers are there. But in practical terms it
 * isn't clear if this situation is possible (e.g. I suspect one can only turn
 * off Bluetooth, not sub-select between BLE and Bluetooth) and second it's more
 * complexity than we really need at this point.
 *
 * ### Handling discoveryAdvertisingStatus events
 *
 * If we have been notified via a discoveryAdvertisingStatus event that
 * discovery is no longer available then we MUST treat existing discovered
 * Bluetooth peers as no longer being available, remove them from the
 * availability cache and send peerAvailabilityChanged events reporting this
 * fact. Eventually we might get more flexible here and allow Bluetooth peers to
 * remain "available" and just use the connection heuristics described
 * previously to mark them as absent when necessary. But for now let's keep
 * things simple.
 *
 * If we have been notified via a discoveryAdvertisingStatus event that
 * advertising is no longer available this should not cause any change in our
 * information about peers we have discovered or will yet discover.
 *
 * ## iOS + MPCF
 *
 * ### Handling nonTCPPeerAvailabilityChanged events
 *
 * In this section we will walk through different possible scenarios when we
 * receive a nonTCPPeerAvailabilityChanged event in iOS.
 *
 * Note that portNumber isn't set in nonTCPPeerAvailabilityChanged events in
 * iOS.
 *
 * #### peerAvailable === true
 *
 * If the peer is not in the availability cache then we MUST put the peer's
 * identifier and generation into the availability cache and issue a
 * peerAvailabilityChanged event with the given peerIdentifier and
 * connectionType, peerAvailable set to true, generation set as in the
 * nonTCPPeerAvailabilityChanged event and newAddressPort set to false.
 *
 * If the peer is in the availability cache then we MUST compare the generation
 * in the event against the same value in the availability cache. If the
 * generation in the nonTCPPeerAvailabilityChanged event is equal to or less
 * than the generation in the availability cache then the event MUST be ignored.
 * If the generation in the event is greater than the value in the availability
 * cache then we MUST issue a peerAvailabilityChanged event with the
 * peerIdentifier and generation set as per the nonTCPPeerAvailabilityChanged
 * event. The connectionType set to MPCF. peerAvailable set to true and
 * newAddressPort set to false.
 *
 * #### peerAvailable === false
 *
 * If the peer is not in the availability cache (this shouldn't be possible,
 * because in iOS we should only be removing peers when we get an unavailable
 * event) then the nonTCPPeerAvailabilityChanged event MUST be ignored.
 *
 * If the peer is in the availability cache then we MUST remove the peer from
 * the availability cache and issue a peerAvailabilityChanged event with the
 * given peerIdentifier and connectionType but with peerAvailable set to false
 * and generation and newAddressPort set to null.
 *
 * __Open Issue:__ How does MPCF deal with peers who have gone out of range?
 * Do they regularly send foundPeer messages or do they send one foundPeer
 * message and go quiet until they send a lostPeer message after a bit?
 *
 * __Open Issue:__ How reliable is the lostPeer message from MPCF? I believe
 * we have had a suspicion that even if we get a lostPeer we might still be able
 * to open a connection to that peer successfully (this would make sense if
 * discovery is over Bluetooth and data transfer over Wifi). But we need to now
 * make this concrete since we have to decide if we are going to put this
 * suspicion into our code.
 *
 * ### Handling multiConnectConnectionFailure events
 *
 * If the peer identified in the event is not in the availability cache (which
 * is theoretically possible given certain race conditions) then we MUST ignore
 * this event.
 *
 * If the peer is in the availability cache then we MUST issue a
 * peerAvailabilityChanged event with the peerIdentifier and connectionType
 * defined as given, peerAvailable set to true, generation set as in the cache
 * and newAddressPort set to true.
 *
 * Note that automatically issuing a newAddressPort = true
 * peerAvailabilityChanged event can cause fun race conditions where we could
 * get ready to advertise a newAddressPort = true event but first a real
 * peerAvailability = false event could come up from the native layer. This
 * would trick the upper layers into thinking the peer is available when they
 * are not. But in that case the call to getPeerHostInfo would fail because the
 * peer wouldn't be in the available cache anymore.
 *
 * ### Handling networkChanged events
 *
 * If we have been notified via a networkChanged event that one of Bluetooth or
 * Wifi are no longer available but not both then this should not cause any
 * immediate action since MPCF seems able to run exclusively over one transport
 * or the other.
 *
 * If however we have been notified via a networkChanged even that both
 * Bluetooth and Wifi are no longer available then we MUST mark all peers that
 * we have previously advertised as available as now being unavailable and
 * advertise this change via the peerAvailabilityChanged event.
 *
 * ### Handling discoveryAdvertisingStatus events
 *
 * If we have been notified via a discoveryAdvertisingStatus event that
 * discovery is no longer available then we MUST change the availability of
 * peers discovered via MPCF as not available and advertise this fact via
 * peerAvailabilityChanged.
 *
 * __Open Issue:__ The MPCF explicitly states that one shouldn't keep discovery
 * on all the time. One suspects this is because they are using Bluetooth for
 * discovery. As such as may need to cycle discovery on and off to save battery.
 * In that case we will need to change the logic above so that turning off
 * discovery doesn't make the peer appear to be gone.
 *
 * If we have been notified via a discoveryAdvertisingStatus even that
 * advertising is no longer available then this should not cause any change in
 * our peer status.
 *
 * ## Wifi
 *
 * ### Handling wifiPeerAvailabilityChanged
 *
 * #### hostAddress & portNumber !== null
 *
 * If the peer is not in the availability cache then we MUST put the peer's
 * identifier, generation, hostAddress and portNumber into the cache and
 * generate a peerAvailabilityChanged event with the given peerIdentifier and
 * connectionType, peerAvailable set to true, generation set as in the
 * wifiPeerAvailabilityChanged event and newAddressPort set to false.
 *
 * If the peer is in the availability cache then we MUST compare the generation,
 * hostAddress and portNumber. If only the generation has changed and if the
 * generation is <= to the generation in the availability cache then the
 * wifiPeerAvailabilityChanged event MUST be ignored. If the generation in the
 * event is greater than the value in the cache and/or either hostAddress or
 * portNumber in the event are different than the cache then a new
 * peerAvailabilityChanged event MUST be issued as defined below.
 *
 * The new peerAvailabilityChanged event as required in the previous paragraph
 * will have the peerIdentifier and generation set based on the values in the
 * wifiPeerAvailabilityChanged event. connectionType will be set to wifi.
 * peerAvailable will be set to true. If either the hostAddress or portNumber
 * in the wifiPeerAvailabilityChanged event is different than either of those
 * values in the availability cache then newAddressPort MUST be set to true.
 * The availability cache MUST also be updated with the generation, hostAddress
 * and portNumber from the wifiPeerAvailabilityChanged event.
 *
 * #### hostAddress or portNumber !== null
 *
 * Note that if either is null both MUST be null but we should trigger this
 * behavior if either is null.
 *
 * If the peer is not in the availability cache (which can happen thanks to our
 * heuristics) then we MUST ignore the wifiPeerAvailabilityChanged event.
 *
 * If the peer is in our cache then we MUST remove the peer from the
 * availability cache and issue a peerAvailabilityChanged event with the given
 * peerIdentifier and connectionType but with peerAvailable set to false and
 * generation and newAddressPort set to null.
 *
 * #### Peer availability timer
 *
 * Although SSDP supports an explicit 'byebye' message to indicate that the
 * network stack is shutting down we are not guaranteed to get a 'byebye'
 * message as the device might simple go out of range.
 *
 * To handle this we will create a timer but it's behavior is different than the
 * Android timer because we can get the equivalent of peerAvailable === false
 * and we do not have any way (since we aren't going to introduce a TCP proxy
 * just for this) to track if the sessions between the local peer and the remote
 * peer are still running.
 *
 * When we get a hostAddress or portNumber !== null and if the peer is not in
 * the availability cache then as part of putting it into the cache we MUST set
 * a timer to go off after thaliConfig.WAIT_UNTIL_WIFI_PEER_GONE_MS. Any time we
 * get another hostAddress or portNumber !== null for a peer that is in the
 * availability cache we MUST restart its timer.
 *
 * If we receive a hostAddress or portNumber === null for a peer who is in the
 * availability cache then we MUST disable the timer along with the other
 * behavior specified previously for this event.
 *
 * If the timer goes off then we MUST remove the associated peer from the
 * availability cache and we MUST issue a peerAvailabilityChanged event with the
 * given peerIdentifier and connectionType but with peerAvailable set to false
 * and generation and newAddressPort set to null.
 *
 * Note that having the timer go off could theoretically mean we announce a peer
 * who we are in the middle of talking to as being gone but this is highly
 * unlikely. The SSDP announcements go over the same channel as the TCP
 * connections and SSDP is quite chatty.
 *
 * ### Handling networkChanged events
 *
 * If we have been notified via a networkChanged event that Wifi is no longer
 * available then all peers discovered via Wifi MUST be marked as not present
 * and this fact advertised via peerAvailabilityChanged as previously specified.
 *
 * ### Handling discoveryAdvertisingStatus events
 *
 * If we have been notified via a discoveryAdvertisingStatus event that
 * discovery is no longer available then we MUST change the availability of
 * peers discovered via Wifi to not available and advertise this fact via
 * peerAvailabilityChanged. This is a bit harsh since if Wifi is still working
 * we certainly could connect to those peers but once discovery is off we have
 * no way of knowing if the peer has disappeared and since we don't have a proxy
 * architecture we can't detect failed connections. So it's just easier for now
 * to just treat the peers as gone.
 *
 * If we have been notified via a discoveryAdvertisingStatus event that
 * advertising is no longer available then this should not cause any change in
 * our peer status.
 *
 * @public
 * @event module:thaliMobile.event:peerAvailabilityChanged
 * @typedef {Object} peerAvailabilityStatus
 * @property {string} peerIdentifier This is exclusively used to detect if
 * this is a repeat announcement or if a peer has gone to correlate it to the
 * announcement of the peer's presence. But this value is not used to establish
 * a connection to the peer, the hostAddress and portNumber handle that.
 * @property {module:ThaliMobileNativeWrapper~connectionTypes} connectionType
 * Defines the kind of connection that the request will eventually go over. This
 * information is needed so that we can better manage how we use the different
 * transport types available to us.
 * @property {boolean} peerAvailable
 * @property {?number} generation This value is only relevant if peerAvailable
 * is set to true. This identifies the current generation for the peer. This
 * indicates that the state of the associated peer has changed. In general one
 * can use the differences in generation count to tell how many changes have
 * occurred to the peer but note that Android currently rolls over its counter
 * which is only 1 byte long. Also note that we have Zombie problems with
 * Android where it is possible to get notification for the same generation
 * multiple times (although not in a row, e.g. we can get generation 0, 1 and
 * then 0 but not generation 0 and then another generation 0) and it is possible
 * to get generations out of order (e.g. get generation 2 before generation 1).
 * @property {?boolean} newAddressPort This value is only relevant if
 * peerAvailable is set to true. If set to true then this announcement means
 * that the peer has changed either its address or port and any existing
 * sessions SHOULD be terminated and a new call to {@link getPeerHostInfo}
 * SHOULD be made to find the new address/port.

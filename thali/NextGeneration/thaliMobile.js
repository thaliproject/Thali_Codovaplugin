/**
 * This method MUST be called before any other method here other than registering for events on the emitter. This

 * {@link module:ThaliWifiInfrastructure} class. Note that in the case of wifi this
 * call really does nothing but register the router object. In the case of native however there is some setup
 * work so an error is more meaningful. If an error is received from start on either wifi or native then
 * any subsequent method calls below but stop will not attempt to interact with the failed type. And yes, if both fail
 * then essentially all the methods but stop turn into NOOPs.
 *
 * This method also instructs the system to pay attention to network events. If one or both radio types is not
 * active but a network changed event indicates that the relevant radio type is now active and if we are still in the
 * start state then this code MUST try to call start on the newly activated radio stack. At that point if the
 * object is in the start state for discovery or advertising then we MUST also try to call the relevant start
 * methods there as well.
 *
 * This method is not idempotent. If called two times in a row without an intervening stop a "Call Stop!" Error MUST
 * be returned.

 * This method can be called after stop since this is a singleton object.

 * event. In other words if {@module:thaliMobile.start} is called and say WiFi doesn't work. Then this method
 * is called and so advertising is only started for the non-TCP transport. Then a network changed event happens
 * indicating that WiFi is available. Since we are still in start state this code will automatically call

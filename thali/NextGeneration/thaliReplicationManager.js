      Ideally we could call startListening and startUpdateAdvertising separately
      but this causes problems in iOS. The issue is that we deal with the
      restriction that there can only be one MCSession between two devices by
      having a leader election where one device will always form the session.
      Imagine that there is device A and B. B is advertising. A hears the
      advertisement and wants to connect but it can't start the session. So what
      it has to do is send an invite to B, who will reject the invite but then
      respond with its own invite to A. For this to work however B has to be
      listening for advertisements (not just making them) because otherwise
      there is no way in iOS for A to ask B for a session (that will be
      refused). Simultaneously A must be listening for advertisements (or it
      wouldn't have heard B) and it must be advertising itself or B couldn't
      establish the MCSession with it. So in practice this means that in iOS
      everyone has to be both listening and advertising at the same time.

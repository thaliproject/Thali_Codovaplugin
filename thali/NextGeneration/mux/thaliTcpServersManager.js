/**
 * @classdesc This is where we manage creating multiplex objects. For all
 * intents and purposes this file should be treated as part of {@link
 * module:thaliMobileNativeWrapper}. We have broken this functionality out here
 * in order to make the code more maintainable and easier to follow.
 *
 * This code is for 'connect' platforms only.
 *
 * When dealing with incoming connections this code creates a multiplex object
 * to handle de-multiplexing the incoming connections.
 *
 * In our original design we would advertise a TCP/IP server as soon as we
 * discovered a peer and then connect to Bluetooth when someone connected to
 * the TCP/IP server. This enabled us to create an experience just like WiFi
 * were we could advertise ports and users could connect when they wanted. And
 * if they didn't connect then all we wasted was a TCP/IP listener that wasn't
 * doing anything. But due to the needs of the 'multiConnect' platform we
 * switched to a model where users have to explicitly ask for addresses and
 * ports to connect to a peer. This would have let us simplify this design so
 * that we would first call connect at the native layer and only once that
 * worked would we set up the TCP/IP listener. This would have been a simpler
 * approach. But the existing code, which first sets up the TCP/IP listener and
 * then creates the Bluetooth connection is fully tested so it's not worth the
 * time to change it to a simpler design.
 *
 * A multiplex object will be created when we:
 * - get an incoming connection from the native layer to the portNumber we
 * submitted to startUpdateAdvertisingAndListening
 *  - We create a mux that pipes to the incoming TCP/IP connection.
 * - get a call from getPort
 *  - We create a local listener and return the port. When we get a connection
 *  to that listener then we call native connect, create a connection to the
 *  native connect port, hook the mux to that connection on one end and the
 *  incoming listener to the mux on the other end.
 *
 *  We have two basic kinds of listeners. One type is for incoming
 *  connections from remote peers. In that case we will have a TCP connection
 *  from the native layer connecting to us which we will then connect to a
 *  multiplex object. The other listener is for connections from a Thali App to
 *  a remote peer. In that case we will create a TCP connection to a native
 *  listener and hook our TCP connection into a multiplex object.
 *
 *  But the point is that each listener has at its root a TCP connection either
 *  going out to or coming in from the native layer. Because keeping native
 *  connections open eats battery we don't want to let connections hang open
 *  unused. This is why we put a timeout on the TCP connection under the
 *  multiplex. That connection sees all traffic in both directions (e.g. even in
 *  the iOS case where we mux connections both ways) and so it knows if anything
 *  is happening. If all is quiet then it knows it can kill the connection.
 *
 *  Note that the connection killing behavior is probably not a good idea and
 *  at some point we should change it, please see
 *  https://github.com/thaliproject/Thali_CordovaPlugin/issues/859.
 *
 *  We also need to deal with cleaning things up when they go wrong.
 *  Typically we will focus the cleanup code on the multiplex object. It will
 *  first close the TCP connections with the Thali app then the multiplex
 *  streams connected to those TCP connections then it will close the listener
 *  and any native connections before closing itself.
 *
 *  Separately it is possible for individual multiplexed TCP connections to
 *  die or the individual streams they are connected to can die. This only
 *  requires local clean up. We just have to be smart so we don't try to close
 *  things that are already closed. So when a TCP connection gets a closed event
 *  it has to detect if it was closed by the underlying multiplex stream or by a
 *  TCP level error. If it was closed by the multiplex stream then it shouldn't
 *  call close on the multiplex stream it is paired with otherwise it should.
 *  The same logic applies when an individual stream belonging to multiplex
 *  object gets closed. Was it closed by its paired TCP connection? If so, then
 *  it's done. Otherwise it needs to close that connection.

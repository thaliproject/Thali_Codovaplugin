/**
 * @file
 *
 * This is where we manage creating multiplex objects. For all intents and
 * purposes this file should be treated as part of {@link
 * module:thaliMobileNative}. We have broken this functionality out here in
 * order to make the code more maintainable and easier to follow.
 *
 * When dealing with incoming connections this code creates a multiplex object
 * to handle de-multiplexing the incoming connections and in the iOS case to
 * also send TCP/IP connections down the incoming connection (reverse the
 * polarity as it were).
 *
 * When dealing with discovered peers we like to advertise a port that the
 * Thali Application can connect to in order to talk to that peer. But for perf
 * reasons that port is typically not connected to anything at the native layer
 * (with the exception of a lexically smaller peer) until someone connects to
 * the port. The reason for this design (thanks Ville!) is to make non-TCP and
 * TCP peers look the same. There is an address (in this case 127.0.0.1) and a
 * port and you connect and there you go. This file defines all the magic needed
 * to create the illusion that a non-TCP peer is actually available over TCP.
 *
 * There are three different scenarios where multiplex objects can get
 * created:
 *
 * Android
 * - We get an incoming connection from the native layer to the portNumber we
 * submitted to startUpdateAdvertisingAndListening
 *  - We create a mux that pipes to the incoming TCP/IP connection.
 * - We get a peerAvailabilityChanged Event
 *  - We create a local listener and advertise nonTCPPeerAvailabilityChanged.
 *  When we get a connection to that listener then we call native connect,
 *  create a connection to the native connect port, hook the mux to that
 *  connection on one end and the incoming listener to the mux on the other end.
 *
 * iOS - Lexically Smaller Peer
 * - We get an incoming connection from the native layer to the portNumber we
 * submitted to startUpdateAdvertisingAndListening
 *  - We create a mux that pipes to the incoming TCP/IP connection. We keep
 *  track of this mux because we might need it in the next entry. Remember, we
 *  don't know which peer made the incoming connection.
 * - We get a peerAvailabilityChanged Event
 *  - Because we are lexically smaller this event will have pleaseConnect set
 *  to false. So we create a port and advertise it on
 *  nonTCPPeerAvailabilityChanged. When we get a connection we call connect. If
 *  there is already an incoming connection then the connect will return with
 *  the clientPort/serverPort and we will re-use the existing mux If there is no
 *  existing incoming connection then the system will wait to trigger the
 *  lexically larger peer to create it and once it is created and properly
 *  terminated (per the previous section) then we will find the mux via
 *  clientPort/ServerPort.
 *
 * iOS - Lexically Larger Peer
 * - We get an incoming connection from the native layer to the portNumber we
 * submitted to startUpdateAdvertisingAndListening
 *  - It isn't possible.
 * - We get a peerAvailabilityChanged Event
 *  - If the peerAvailabilityChanged Event has pleaseConnect set to true then
 *  baring any limitation on available resources we should immediately issue a
 *  connect and hook in the mux to it configured to handling incoming
 *  connections and then create a TCP listener and have it use createStream with
 *  the mux for any incoming connections. Obviously if we already have a
 *  connection to the identified peer then we can ignore the pleaseConnect
 *  value.
 *  - If the peerAvailabilityChanged Event has pleaseConnect set to false
 *  then we will set up a TCP listener and advertise the port but we won't
 *  create the mux or call connect until the first connection to the TCP
 *  listener comes in.
 *
 *  We have two basic kinds of listeners. One type is for incoming
 *  connections from remote peers. In that case we will have a TCP connection
 *  from the native layer connecting to us which we will then connect to a
 *  multiplex object. The other listener is for connections from a Thali App to
 *  a remote peer. In that case we will create a TCP connection to a native
 *  listener and hook our TCP connection into a multiplex object. And of course
 *  with the iOS situation sometimes it all gets mixed up.
 *
 *  But the point is that each listener has at its root a TCP connection
 *  either going out to or coming in from the native layer. Because keeping
 *  native connections open eats battery (although this is probably a much less
 *  significant issue with iOS due to its UDP based design) we don't want to let
 *  connections hang open unused. This is why we put a timeout on the TCP
 *  connection under the multiplex. That connection sees all traffic in both
 *  directions (e.g. even in the iOS case where we mux connections both ways)
 *  and so it knows if anything is happening. If all is quiet then it knows it
 *  can kill the connection.
 *
 *  We also need to deal with cleaning things up when they go wrong.
 *  Typically we will focus the cleanup code on the multiplex object. It will
 *  first close the TCP connections with the Thali app then the multiplex
 *  streams connected to those TCP connections then it will close the listener
 *  and any native connections before closing itself.
 *
 *  Separately it is possible for individual multiplexed TCP connections to
 *  die or the individual streams they are connected to can die. This only
 *  requires local clean up. We just have to be smart so we don't try to close
 *  things that are already closed. So when a TCP connection gets a closed event
 *  it has to detect if it was closed by the underlying multiplex stream or by a
 *  TCP level error. If it was closed by the multiplex stream then it shouldn't
 *  call close on the multiplex stream it is paired with otherwise it should.
 *  The same logic applies when an individual stream belonging to multiplex
 *  object gets closed. Was it closed by its paired TCP connection? If so, then
 *  it's done. Otherwise it needs to close that connection.

 *
 * ## TCP Listener
 *
 * ### Connect Event
 *
 * A multiplex object MUST be created and MUST be directly piped in both
 * directions with the TCP socket returned by the listener. We MUST set a
 * timeout on the incoming TCP socket to a reasonable value for the platform.
 * The created multiplex object MUST be recorded with an index of the client
 * port used by the incoming TCP socket.
 *
 * ### Error Event
 *
 * The error MUST be logged.
 *
 * ### Close Event
 *
 * We MUST call destroy on all multiplex objects spawned by this TCP listener.
 *
 * ## Incoming TCP socket returned by the server's connect event
 *
 * ### Error Event
 *
 * The error MUST be logged.
 *
 * ### Timeout Event
 *
 * Destroy MUST be called on the piped multiplex object. This will trigger a
 * total cleanup.
 *
 * ### Close Event
 *
 * If this close is not the result of a destroy on the multiplex object then
 * destroy MUST be called on the multiplex object.
 *
 * ## Multiplex Object
 *
 * ### onStream Callback
 *
 * The incoming stream MUST cause us to create a net.createConnection to
 * routerPort and to then take the new TCP socket and pipe it in both directions
 * with the newly created stream. We MUST track the TCP socket so we can clean
 * it up later. Note that the TCP socket will track its associated stream and
 * handle cleaning it up. If the TCP socket cannot be connected to routerPort
 * then a routerPortConnectionFailed event MUST be fired and destroy MUST be
 * called on the stream provided in the callback.
 *
 * ### Error Event
 *
 * The error MUST be logged.
 *
 * ### Close Event
 *
 * Destroy MUST first be called on all the TCP sockets we created to routerPort
 * (the TCP sockets will then close their associated multiplex streams). Then we
 * MUST call Destroy on the incoming TCP socket from the native layer. Note that
 * in some cases one or more of these objects could already be closed before we
 * call destroy so we MUST be prepared to catch any exceptions. Finally we MUST
 * remove the multiplex object from the list of multiplex objects we are
 * maintaining.
 *
 * ## TCP client socket created by net.createConnection call from multiplex
 * object
 *
 * ### Error Event
 *
 * The error MUST be logged.
 *
 * ### Close Event
 *
 * Destroy MUST be called on the stream this TCP socket is piped to assuming
 * that it wasn't that stream that called destroy on the TCP client socket.
 *
 * ## multiplex onStream stream
 *
 * ### Error Event
 *
 * The error MUST be logged.
 *
 * ### Close Event
 *
 * If the close did not come from the TCP socket this stream is piped to then
 * close MUST be called on the associated TCP socket.
 *
 * @private
 * @param {number} routerPort Port that the router object submitted to
 * {@link module:ThaliMobileNativeWrapper.startUpdateAdvertisingAndListening} is hosted on. This value was passed into this object's constructor.
 * @returns {Promise<number|Error>} The port that the mux is listening on for
 * connections from the native layer or an Error object.

/**
 * This creates a local TCP server to accept incoming connections from the Thali
 * app that will be sent to the identified peer.
 *
 * If this method is called before start is called then a "Start First!" error
 * MUST be thrown. If this method is called after stop is called then a "We are
 * stopped!" error MUST be thrown.
 *
 * If there is already a TCP server listening for connections to the submitted
 * peerIdentifier then the port for the TCP server MUST be returned.
 *
 * If there is no existing TCP server for the specified peer then we MUST
 * examine how many peers we are advertising 127.0.0.1 ports for. If that number
 * is equal to maxPeersToAdvertise then we MUST call destroy on one of those TCP
 * listeners before continuing with this method. That way we will never offer
 * connections to more than maxPeersToAdvertise peers at a time. We should
 * exclude all TCP servers that have active multiplex objects and pick a TCP
 * server to close based on FIFO. Once we have closed the TCP server, if
 * necessary, then a new TCP server MUST be created on port 0 (e.g. any
 * available port) and configured as follows:
 *
 * ## TCP server

 * If pleaseConnect is true then an immediate call MUST be made to {@link
 * external:"Mobile('connect')".callNative} to connect to the specified peer. If
 * that call fails then the error MUST be returned. Otherwise a new multiplex
 * object MUST be created and a new TCP connection via net.createConnection
 * pointed at the port returned by the connect call. The multiplex object MUST
 * be piped in both directions with the new TCP connection. The TCP connection
 * MUST have setTimeout called on it and set to a reasonable value for the
 * platform.
 *
 * ### Connection Event

 * #### First call to connection event when pleaseConnect is false

 * If pleaseConnect is false then when the first connection event occurs we MUST
 * issue a {@link external:"Mobile('connect')".callNative} for the requested
 * peer and handle the response as given in the following sections.
 *
 * ##### Error

 * If we get an error then we MUST close the TCP connection and fire a {@link
 * event:failedConnection} event with the returned error.
 *
 * ##### listenerPort

 * If the response is listenerPort then we MUST perform the actions specified
 * above for pleaseConnect is true with the exception that if the connect fails
 * then we MUST call close on the TCP server since the peer is not available and
 * fire a {@link event:failedConnection} event with the error set to "Cannot
 * Connect To Peer".
 *
 * ##### clientPort/serverPort

 * If clientPort/serverPort are not null then we MUST confirm that the
 * serverPort matches the port that the server created in {@link
 * module:TCPServersManager.createNativeListener} is listening on and if not
 * then we MUST call destroy on the incoming TCP connection, fire a {@link
 * event:failedConnection} event with the error set to "Mismatched serverPort",
 * and act as if connection had not been called (e.g. the next connection will
 * be treated as the first).
 *
 * Otherwise we must then lookup the multiplex object via the clientPort. If
 * there is no multiplex object associated with that clientPort then we have a
 * race condition where the incoming connection died between when the connect
 * response was sent and now. In that case we MUST call destroy on the incoming
 * TCP connection, first a {@link event:failedConnection} event with the error
 * set to "Incoming connection died" and as previously described treat the next
 * connection as if it were the first.
 *
 * Otherwise we MUST configure the multiplex object with the behavior specified
 * below.
 *
 * #### Standard connection event behavior

 * Each socket returned by the connection event MUST cause a call to
 * createStream on the multiplex object and the returned stream MUST be piped in
 * both directions with the connection TCP socket.
 *
 * ### Error Event

 * The error MUST be logged.
 *
 * ### Close Event

 * All the TCP sockets to routerPort MUST first be destroyed. Then all the TCP
 * sockets from the Thali application MUST be destroyed.
 *
 * Unless destroy was called on the TCP server by the multiplex object then
 * destroy MUST be called on the multiplex object.
 *
 * ## Multiplex object

 * ### onStream callback

 * If a stream is received a call to net.createConnection MUST be made pointed
 * at routerPort. If the TCP connection cannot be successfully connected then a
 * {@link event:routerPortConnectionFailed} MUST be fired and destroy MUST be
 * called on the stream. Otherwise the TCP connection and the stream MUST be
 * piped to each other in both directions.
 *
 * Note that we will support the ability to accept incoming connections over the
 * multiplex object even for platforms like Android that do not need it. This is
 * just to keep the code and testing simple and consistent.
 *
 * ### Error Event

 * The error MUST be logged.
 *
 * ### Close Event

 * If the destroy didn't come the TCP server then destroy MUST be called on the
 * TCP server. If the destroy didn't come from the TCP native socket then
 * destroy MUST be called on the TCP native socket.
 *
 * ## TCP socket to native layer

 * ### Timeout Event

 * Destroy MUST be called on itself.
 *
 * ### Error Event

 * The error MUST be logged.
 *
 * ### Close Event

 * Destroy MUST be called on the multiplex object the stream is piped to.
 *
 * ## TCP socket from Thali Application

 * ### Error Event

 * The error MUST be logged.
 *
 * ### Close Event

 * Destroy MUST be called on the stream object the socket is piped to if that
 * isn't the object that called destroy on the socket.
 *
 * ## createStream Socket

 * ### Error Event

 * The error MUST be logged.
 *
 * ### Close Event

 * If destroy wasn't called by the TCP socket from Thali Application the stream
 * is piped to then destroy MUST be called on that TCP socket.
 *
 * ## TCP socket to routerPort

 * ### Error Event

 * The error MUST be logged.
 *
 * ### Close Event

 * Destroy MUST be called on the stream object the socket is piped to if that
 * isn't the object that called destroy on the socket.
 *
 * ## onStream callback stream

 * ### Error Event

 * The error MUST be logged.
 *
 * ### Close Event

 * If destroy wasn't called by the TCP socket to routerPort the stream is piped
 * to then destroy MUST be called on that TCP socket.

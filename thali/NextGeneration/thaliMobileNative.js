/**
 * @file This file defines the contract for the Mobile bindings that Thali
 * provides for JXcore's native call interface. The actual API calls will "just
 * be there" since they are added to the global environment via JXcore's native
 * binding mechanism. It is expected that these methods will not be called
 * directly but rather will be called via the {@link
 * module:thaliMobileNativeWrapper} wrappers.
 *
 * The primary use of these apis is to enable us to leverage non-TCP/IP
 * capabilities on various devices we run on. In the case of Android this is a
 * combination of BLE (for discovery) and Bluetooth (for high bandwidth data
 * transfer). In the case of iOS this is multi-peer connectivity framework which
 * runs on a mix of Bluetooth, an Apple proprietary variant of Wi-Fi Direct and
 * normal Wi-Fi (if connected to an access point that supports local multi-cast
 * and connectivity between devices on the same AP or network of local APs).
 * Note that Apple's multi-peer connectivity framework actually appears to use a
 * combination of TCP and UDP in some cases but it does not expose a TCP level
 * socket. So although TCP/IP is involved nevertheless that use of TCP is hidden
 * from programs using the multi-peer connectivity framework and so for all
 * intents and purposes it is a non-TCP/IP transport.
 *
 * This library also provides information from the native platform such as
 * information about network connectivity.
 *
 * Note that callbacks rather than promises are specified below because that
 * is required by the JXcore native API.
 *
 * ## Request processing model
 *
 * With the exception of `connect` the `callNative` methods defined in this
 * file MUST only be called serially. That is, once a `callNative` method other
 * than `connect` is called no other `callNative` methods but `connect` can be
 * called until the first `callNative`'s callback has been called. If this
 * prohibition is violated then the system will enter an undefined state.
 *
 * ## Idempotent calls
 *
 * All stop methods are idempotent. So multiple calls will not result in a
 * state change.
 *
 * All stop methods are always safe to call even if their start paired method
 * has not yet been called. The default start state is "stop" so calling a stop
 * method before calling its start method pair just means to stay in the stop
 * state.
 *
 * ## Initial system state When a Thali app starts up and before any of the
 * APIs defined here are called the initial state of the system MUST be:
 * - No listening for discovery announcements using the native facilities
 * - No listening for incoming connections using the native facilities
 * - No advertising information using the native facilities

/**
 * When we are asked to connect to a remote peer the way we normally handles
 * this is by opening a port on 127.0.0.1 and listening for an incoming
 * connection. When we get the incoming connection we then bridge it to the
 * remote peer.
 *
 * When we are using our normal behavior the listeningPort parameter will be
 * set to the port the local Thali application should connect to and both
 * clientPort and serverPort MUST be null.
 *
 * However, we also have to deal with a bug in iOS's multipeer connectivity
 * framework. Our original iOS design involved us having one MCSession that
 * connected peer A as a TCP/IP client to peer B and then a second MCSession
 * that connected peer B as a TCP/IP client to peer A. But there is apparently a
 * bug in iOS that if two peers have two MCSessions and if one moves around a
 * bunch of data then the connections become unstable and randomly fail.
 *
 * Our work around for this problem is that we will always form exactly one
 * MCSession between two peers. So let's say that peer A establishes a MCSession
 * with peer B. In that case peer A will create an output stream to peer B who
 * will then respond with an output stream to peer A. We will then marshal these
 * streams to TCP/IP by exposing peer A as a TCP/IP listener that peer A
 * connects to and sends data to peer B. Peer B will see the connection as an
 * incoming TCP/IP client that connects to Peer B's `portNumber`.
 *
 * Now imagine that Peer B issues a connect request to Peer A's
 * `peerIdentifier`. Ideally we would just create a new MCSession and do what we
 * described above in reverse. But we cannot because of the bug. So the work
 * around is that we will use this type to notify the caller that what they have
 * to do is to use the existing connection from Peer A to Peer B to send TCP/IP
 * connection requests back to Peer A. This involves magic at the mux layer. In
 * other words we are pushing an iOS bug up from the iOS native code into
 * Node.js and requiring us to solve it up in Node.js land. For all the gory
 * details on how this works see the [binding
 * spec](http://www.thaliproject.org/presenceprotocolBindings.md).
 *
 * We use the `clientPort` value below so that the mux layer can figure out
 * which of its connections is the one it needs to use to talk to the desired
 * peer.
 *
 * We use the `serverPort` to indicate which 127.0.0.1 port we connected to.
 * The reason we include it here is because there is a potential race condition
 * where between the time we created the response to the connect request and
 * when it was actually sent to Node.js in theory we could have received a stop
 * and start that switched us to a different `portNumber`. So by including
 * `serverPort` we can catch those race conditions.
 *
 * @public
 * @typedef {Object} ListenerOrIncomingConnection
 * @property {number} listeningPort The port on which the native layer is
 * listening on 127.0.0.1 for an incoming TCP/IP connection that the native
 * layer will then relay to the remote peer.
 * @property {number} clientPort The port that the native layer's TCP/IP
 * client uses to connect to the `portNumber` submitted by the Thali
 * application.
 * @property {number} serverPort The port that the native layer's TCP/IP

/**
 * This method tells the native layer to establish a non-TCP/IP connection to
 * the identified peer and to then create a TCP/IP bridge on top of that
 * connection which can be accessed locally by opening a TCP/IP connection to
 * the port returned in the callback.
 *
 * This method MUST return an error if called while start listening for
 * advertisements is not active. This restriction is really only needed for iOS
 * but we enforce it on Android as well in order to keep the platform
 * consistent.
 *
 * If this method is called consecutively with the same peerIdentifier then if
 * a connection already exists its port MUST be returned otherwise a new
 * connection MUST be created. In the case of Android there MUST be at most one
 * Bluetooth client connection between this peer and the identified remote peer.
 * In the case of iOS there MUST be at most one MCSession between this peer and
 * the identified remote peer. In the case of iOS if this peer is lexically
 * smaller than the other peer then the iOS layer MUST try to establish a
 * MCSession with the remote peer as a signaling mechanism per the instructions
 * in the binding spec. If an incoming connection is created within a reasonable
 * time period from the lexically larger peer then the system MUST issue a
 * connect callback with listeningPort set to null and clientPort/serverPort set
 * based on the values used when establishing the incoming connection from the
 * remote peer.
 *
 * The port created by a connect call MUST only accept a single TCP/IP
 * connection at a time. Any subsequent TCP/IP connections to the 127.0.0.1 port
 * MUST be rejected.
 *
 * It is implementation dependent if the non-TCP/IP connection that the
 * 127.0.0.1 port will be bound to is created before the callback is called or
 * only when the TCP/IP port is first connected to.
 *
 * If any of the situations listed below occur then the non-TCP/IP connection
 * MUST be fully closed, the existing connection to the 127.0.0.1 port (if any)
 * MUST be closed and the port MUST be released:
 *
 *  - The TCP/IP connection to the 127.0.0.1 port is closed or half closed
 *  - No connection is made to the 127.0.0.1 port within a fixed period of
 *  time, typically 2 seconds (this only applies on Android and for lexically
 *  larger iOS peers)
 *  - If the non-TCP/IP connection should fail in whole or in part (e.g. some
 *  non-TCP/IP transports have the TCP/IP equivalent of a 1/2 closed connection)
 *
 * A race condition exists that can cause something called a "channel binding
 * problem". This race condition occurs when a callback to this method is
 * received with a port but before the port can be used it gets closed and
 * re-assign to someone else. The conditions under which this occur typically
 * involve interactions with the native system and other parallel
 * threads/processes. But if this happens then the client code can think that a
 * certain port represents a particular peer when it may not.
 *
 * Typically we use TLS to address this problem for connections run on the
 * multiplexer layer that sits on top of the port returned by this method. TLS
 * allows us to authenticate that we are talking with whom we think we are
 * talking. But if TLS can't be used then some equivalent mechanism must be or
 * an impersonation attack becomes possible.

 * | Error String | Description |
 * |--------------|-------------|
 * | Illegal peerID | The peerID has a format that could not have been returned by the local platform |
 * | startListeningForAdvertisements is not active | Go start it! |
 * | Connection could not be established | The attempt to connect to the peerID failed. This could be because the peer is gone, no longer accepting connections or the radio stack is just horked. |
 * | Connection wait timed out | This is for the case where we are a lexically smaller peer and the lexically larger peer doesn't establish a connection within a reasonable period of time. |
 * | Max connections reached | The native layers have practical limits on how many connections they can handle at once. If that limit has been reached then this error is returned. The only action to take is to wait for an existing connection to be closed before retrying.  |

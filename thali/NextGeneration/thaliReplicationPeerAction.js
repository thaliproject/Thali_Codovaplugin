 * When start is called we will start a replication with the remote peer using

 * to set the ajax option in order to set the psk related values from
 * peerAdvertisesDataForUs. We will need to create the URL using the
 * hostAddress and portNumber from peerAdvertisesDataForUs. Also make sure to
 * set skip_setup to true.
 *
 * If we get an error that the database doesn't exist on the remote machine that
 * is fine, we're done. Although we should log a low priority error that we
 * tried to get to a database that doesn't exist. DO NOT log the peer ID.
 *
 * We then need to use db.replication.to with the remoteDB using the URL
 * specified in the constructor.. This will be the local DB we
 * will copy to. We need to do things this way so we can set the AJAX
 * options for PSK. We also need to set both options.retry and options.live
 * to true. See the changes event below for some of the implications of this.
 *
 * __OPEN ISSUE:__ I'm only sure that the options.ajax works on the PouchDB
 * constructor. I have no idea if we can submit options.ajax on a replication.
 * If not then we will need to accept a PouchDB constructor object with a DB
 * name and create everything from scratch.
 *
 * __OPEN ISSUE:__ One suspects we need to play around with
 * options.back_off_function to find something that works well for P2P
 * transports.
 *
 * We must hook these events from the replication object.
 *
 * paused - We need to log this with a very low priority log value just for
 * debugging purposes. But certainly nothing that would be recorded in
 * production.
 *
 * active - Log per the previous.
 *
 * denied - This is a genuine error, it should never happen to log with high
 * priority so we can investigate. Again, don't include any identifying
 * information, not even the DB name. It's a hint.
 *
 * complete - Return resolve(); if there was no error otherwise return
 * Reject() with a Error object with the string that either matches one of the
 * {@link module:thaliPeerAction~ThaliPeerAction.start} error strings or
 * else something appropriate. Even if there is an error we should always do a
 * final write to `_Local/<peer ID>` with the last_seq in the info object
 * passed to complete.
 *
 * error - Log with reasonably high priority but with no identifying
 * information. Otherwise take no further action as the complete event
 * should also fire and we'll handle things there.
 *
 * __OPEN ISSUE:__ We actually need to investigate what kinds of err values
 * come back in order to determine if we can figure out if it was a connection
 * error. This is important for the thread pool to know. See the errors defined
 * on {@link module:thaliPeerAction~PeerAction.start}.
 *
 * change - If we don't see any changes on the replication for {@link
 * module:thaliReplicationPeerAction~ThaliReplicatonPeerAction.maxIdlePeriodSeconds}
 * seconds then we will end the replication. The output from this event also
 * provides us with the current last_seq we have synch'd from the remote peer.
 * Per http://thaliproject.org/ReplicationAcrossDiscoveryProtocol/ we need to
 * update the remote `_Local/<peer ID>` document every
 * {@link module:thaliReplicationPeerAction~ThaliReplicationPeerAction.pushLastSyncUpdateMilliseconds}
 *
 * Make sure to keep the cancel object returned by the replicate call. Well
 * need it for kill.

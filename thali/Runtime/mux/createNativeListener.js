/**
 * This method creates a TCP listener (which MUST use {@link
 * module:makeIntoCloseAllServer~makeIntoCloseAllServer}) to handle requests
 * from the native layer and to then pass them through a multiplex object who
 * will route all the multiplexed connections to routerPort, the port the system
 * has hosted the submitted router object on. The TCP listener will be started
 * on port 0 and the port it is hosted on will be returned in the promise. This
 * is the port that MUST be submitted to the native layer's {@link
 * external:"Mobile('startUpdateAdvertisingAndListening')".callNative} command.
 *
 * If this method is called when we are not in the start state then an exception
 * MUST be thrown because this is a private method and something very bad just
 * happened.
 *
 * If this method is called twice an exception MUST be thrown because this
 * should only be called once from the constructor.
 *
 * ## TCP Listener
 *
 * ### Connect Event
 *
 * A multiplex object MUST be created and MUST be directly piped in both
 * directions with the TCP socket returned by the listener. We MUST set a
 * timeout on the incoming TCP socket to a reasonable value for the platform.
 * The created multiplex object MUST be recorded with an index of the client
 * port used by the incoming TCP socket.
 *
 * A unique ID MUST be created for this connection and stored with this
 * connection and then a
 * {@link module:TCPServersManager.event:incomingConnectionState} event MUST
 * be fired.
 *
 * ### Error Event
 *
 * The error MUST be logged.
 *
 * ### Close Event
 *
 * We MUST call destroy on all multiplex objects spawned by this TCP listener.
 *
 * We MUST also fire a
 * {@link module:TCPServersManager.event:incomingConnectionState} event.
 *
 * ## Incoming TCP socket returned by the server's connect event
 *
 * ### Error Event
 *
 * The error MUST be logged.
 *
 * ### Timeout Event
 *
 * Destroy MUST be called on the piped multiplex object. This will trigger a
 * total cleanup.
 *
 * ### Close Event
 *
 * If this close is not the result of a destroy on the multiplex object then
 * destroy MUST be called on the multiplex object.
 *
 * ## Multiplex Object
 *
 * ### onStream Callback
 *
 * The incoming stream MUST cause us to create a net.createConnection to
 * routerPort and to then take the new TCP socket and pipe it in both directions
 * with the newly created stream. We MUST track the TCP socket so we can clean
 * it up later. Note that the TCP socket will track its associated stream and
 * handle cleaning it up. If the TCP socket cannot be connected to routerPort
 * then a routerPortConnectionFailed event MUST be fired and destroy MUST be
 * called on the stream provided in the callback.
 *
 * ### Error Event
 *
 * The error MUST be logged.
 *
 * ### Close Event
 *
 * Destroy MUST first be called on all the TCP sockets we created to routerPort
 * (the TCP sockets will then close their associated multiplex streams). Then we
 * MUST call Destroy on the incoming TCP socket from the native layer. Note that
 * in some cases one or more of these objects could already be closed before we
 * call destroy so we MUST be prepared to catch any exceptions. Finally we MUST
 * remove the multiplex object from the list of multiplex objects we are
 * maintaining.
 *
 * ## TCP client socket created by net.createConnection call from multiplex
 * object
 *
 * ### Error Event
 *
 * The error MUST be logged.
 *
 * ### Close Event
 *
 * Destroy MUST be called on the stream this TCP socket is piped to assuming
 * that it wasn't that stream that called destroy on the TCP client socket.
 *
 * ## multiplex onStream stream
 *
 * ### Error Event
 *
 * The error MUST be logged.
 *
 * ### Close Event
 *
 * If the close did not come from the TCP socket this stream is piped to then
 * close MUST be called on the associated TCP socket.
 *

 * @param {module:thaliTcpServersManager~ThaliTcpServersManager} self The 'this'
 * object from tcpServersManager

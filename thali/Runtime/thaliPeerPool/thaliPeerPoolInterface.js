/**
 * @classdesc Interface for a class that can manage communications with remote
 * peers. All requests to communicate with remote peers are submitted as action
 * class instances to a pool who decides how many actions of which types to
 * allow.
 *
 * __Open Issue:__ One suspects that it will turn out that Bluetooth has a fixed
 * limit for how many connections it can have regardless of who initiated them.
 * But this has not been proved yet. Once it is we will need to specify that the
 * pool has to manage the fixed sum of ingoing and outgoing connections.
 *
 * __Open Issue:__ Have we found a practical limit to how many simultaneous
 * sessions MPCF can handle? One suspects the behavior will be different over
 * Bluetooth vs Apple's proprietary variant of Wifi Direct vs a Wifi AP point.
 * We will have to consider the answer to the question of connection limits when
 * creating an instance of this interface.
 *
 * This is created as an interface in order to allow us to experiment with
 * different approaches for managing bandwidth and to make it easy for third
 * parties to create their own drop in managers.
 *
 * Amongst other things the pool must limit:
 *
 * + How many simultaneous HTTP requests we have outstanding.
 *  + Typically this will be a global pool for Wifi and a per peer pool for
 *  non-TCP transports.
 * + How many incoming peers are allowed to simultaneously have incoming
 * connections over non-TCP transports.

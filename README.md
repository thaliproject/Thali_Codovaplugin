# Thali Cordova Plugin

This project is a work in progress and not yet production-level quality.

The Thali Cordova Plugin is a [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) plugin for building peer-to-peer (P2P) networking apps on Android and iOS.

The Thali Cordova Plugin is layered on the [JXcore Cordova plugin](https://github.com/jxcore/jxcore-cordova), which uses [JXcore](http://jxcore.com/home/) to allow one to build mobile applications in JavaScript for Node.JS.  

## Prerequisites

### Android

Download [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

Make sure to set your `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable:

Mac OS X (put in your `~/.bash_profile` file):
```
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=${PATH}:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

Linux (put in your `~/.bashrc` file):
```
export ANDROID_HOME=/<installation location>/Android/sdk
export PATH=${PATH}:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

Windows:
```
set ANDROID_HOME=C:\<installation location>\Android\sdk
set PATH=%PATH%;%ANDROID_HOME%\tools;%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools
```

### iOS

Download [Xcode 6](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), or later.

## Getting Started

### Install latest Node.JS

Follow the instructions at [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). When you're done, check that the
installation worked:
```
$ node -v
v0.12.7
$ npm -v
2.11.3
```

### Install Cordova

(Check the [Android Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/4.0.0/guide_platforms_android_index.md.html#Android%20Platform%20Guide)
and [iOS Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/4.0.0/guide_platforms_ios_index.md.html#iOS%20Platform%20Guide) for detailed instructions.)

```
$ sudo npm install -g cordova
```

### Create a Cordova project

```
~/Code> cordova create ThaliTest com.test.thalitest ThaliTest
```

### Android Requirements

#### Use Gradle

For the command line build process, you should use gradle. Set the system environment variable `ANDROID_BUILD` to `gradle`.

#### Build the P2P library to local Maven

##### Install Maven locally
Follow the instructions here: http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

##### Clone the Thali Cordova Plugin library
`git clone https://github.com/thaliproject/Thali_CordovaPlugin_BtLibrary.git`  

##### Build the Thali Cordova Plugin library
At the root of the Thali Cordova Plugin Library that you just git cloned:  

`cd BtConnectorLib`

Note: On OS X (and probably Linux) the gradlew file is cloned without execution permissions. So you have to run:

`chmod u+x gradlew`

before you will be able to run the next command.

`./gradlew build install`  

Once built the library should be visible in:  
`<user folder>\.m2\repository\org\thaliproject\p2p\btconnectorlib\btconnectorlib2\0.0.0`


Once built the library should be visible in:  
`<user folder>\.m2\repository\org\thaliproject\p2p\btconnectorlib\btconnectorlib2\0.0.0`

### Using the Thali Cordova Plugin

Follow the instructions below to use the Thali Cordova Plugin on Android and iOS.

#### Android

1. Add the Android platform
   * `cd ThaliTest`
   * `cordova platform add android`
2. Fix manifest min-sdk issue
   * go to `ThaliTest\platforms\android` and in `AndroidManifest.xml` change `android:minSdkVersion="10"` to
    `android:minSdkVersion="16"`
3. Add the plugin
   * `cordova plugin add https://github.com/thaliproject/Thali_Codovaplugin`
4. Fix issue on can not replace existing file
   * from `ThaliTest\plugins\org.thaliproject.p2p\src\android\java\io\jxcore\node` copy
   the `JXcoreExtension.java` to `ThaliTest\platforms\android\src\io\jxcore\node`
(replace file, or copy the plug-in code and add it to existing file)
5. Build the project
   * `cordova build android`

#### iOS

All commands are issued from the the root of the project folder.

1. Add the Thali Cordova Plugin to the Cordova project:
 * `~/Code/ThaliTest> cordova plugin add https://github.com/thaliproject/Thali_CordovaPlugin.git`
2. Add the iOS platform:
 * `~/Code/ThaliTest> cordova platform add ios`
3. Copy Thali Cordova Plugin sample to the Cordova project:
 * `~/Code/ThaliTest> cp -a -R -v plugins/org.thaliproject.p2p/sample/ios/www ./`
4. Build Cordova:
 * `~/Code/ThaliTest> cordova build`
3. Open the iOS Cordova project in Xcode
 * (e.g. `<project_root>/platforms/ios/ThaliTest.xcodeproj`)
 * `~/Code/ThaliTest> open platforms/ios/ThaliTest.xcodeproj`

### Unit Testing the Thali Cordova Plugin

The Thali Cordova plugin uses the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) Behavior Driven Development framework for JavaScript.

#### Desktop Testing

Testing is available on the desktop for the Thali Cordova Plugin which uses a mock object to simulate the native Cordova `Mobile` calls.

To get started, install, Jasmine:
```
$ sudo [npm] install -g jasmine
```

Next, simply run Jasmine which then looks at the specifications in the `specs` folder.  
```
$ jasmine
```

#### Mobile Testing

Testing is also available on the mobile devices as well.  This will use the regular `Mobile` calls directly through Cordova to talk to the underlying system.

To get started, copy the files from `sample/android/www` or `sample/ios/www` to the `www` folder.

Next, install the requirements for testing:
```
$ jx install
```

Finally, build the application and run it on your device.  The test results should be shown in your developer console.
